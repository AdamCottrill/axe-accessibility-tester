* Axe Accessibility Tester

A small test app to that illustrates how Axe accessibility
([[https://www.deque.com/axe/]]) tool can be used to generate
Accessibility reports.

clone the repository into a convenient directory, and install the
associated dependencies:

  yarn install

To generate the reports:

 1. update the list of pages to test by providing a url and report
    name in the file
 2. start the server in production mode (or without the Django debug-
    toolbar). Update the DOMAIN argument in axe.test.js with the
    corresponding host and port.
 3. run the axe tests in a separate console using:

    > yarn test

 4. after the tests are complete, the associated reports can be found
    in ~/axe_reports.

 This script could easily be re-factored into a standalone function
 that accepts target urls and writes the reports to a specific output
 directory.
